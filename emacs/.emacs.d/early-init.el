;;; early-init.el --- Emacs 27+ pre-initialisation config

;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs 27+ loads this file before (normally) calling
;; `package-initialize'.  We use this file to suppress that automatic
;; behaviour so that startup is consistent across Emacs versions.

;;; Code:

(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
(setq vc-follow-symlinks t)

;; Prevent the glimpse of un-styled Emacs by disabling these UI elements early.
(push '(menu-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
(push '(tool-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
(push '(vertical-scroll-bars) default-frame-alist)

;; Resizing the Emacs frame can be a terribly expensive part of changing the
;; font. By inhibiting this, we easily halve startup times with fonts that are
;; larger than the system default.
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)

;; So we can detect this having been loaded
(provide 'early-init)

;;; early-init.el ends here
